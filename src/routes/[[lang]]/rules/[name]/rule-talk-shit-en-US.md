# Talk Shit Definition White Paper

Due to the profound harm that Talk Shit poses to event planning, the following provides a detailed explanation of the
definition of Talk Shit.

## Persistence

As Talk Shit is similar to traditional jokes in nature, both will be explained separately.

A joke is a form of expression that involves wit (ranging from global to interpersonal) or messages of self-deprecation,
mockery, or puns. The recipient can respond with understanding, humor, and other expressions of amusement. Jokes are
typically short-lived bursts of laughter or surprise. However, if a topic persists for an extended period and becomes
the main theme, it is considered Talk Shit. It is important to note that the instigator is always the one who initiates
the non-constructive topic. Common triggers include typographical errors made by Sunny, in which case Sunny is not at
fault. In the following example, Jimmy is the instigator.

### Example) Joke

Sunny: Why am I always single?
Luke: It's actually not difficult.
Terrence: xd
Sunny: Besides insulting you, I have nothing else to add.
(Continuation of the main topic)

### Example) Talk Shit

Sunny: Could you call Alpha?
Rico: Who is Alpha?
Garry: Yuhang
Jimmy: I am Beta
Jimmy: Who wants to be Epsilon?
Garry: I am Omega
(The topic begins to expand)

## Repeatedly Expressing the Same Opinion

This type of Talk Shit often occurs during the event planning process. It involves repeatedly proposing suggestions that
have been rejected by multiple people or are fundamentally impractical, causing the topic to focus on rejecting the
proposal again and causing the discussion to stagnate.

### Example)

Sunny: How about a million dollars?
Everyone: Diu
Sunny: But it's not bad, right?
Sunny: So let's do it.
(Continued presentation of unreasonable suggestions)

## Spamming

This is the most toxic form of Talk Shit, referring to the continuous transmission of non-constructive messages on
discussion platforms. It not only disturbs the members of the discussion but also makes it difficult for new
participants to understand the main purpose of the discussion.

### Example)

Eric: Continuously sending various stickers
Rico: Continuously sending various stickers
(Continuation of the above)

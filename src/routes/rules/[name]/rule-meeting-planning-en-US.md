# White Paper on Group Gathering Planning

This document outlines the planning process for group gathering activities that meet the following criteria: **the number
of participants is more than four**, and **at least 80% of the participants are SXYA members**. The group gathering activities
are **initiated or organized through the following methods**:

- Discussions within this server
- Discussions in designated WhatsApp groups
- Offline discussions
- or other methods recognized by the majority of members

The specific process is as follows:

1. **Preliminary formulation of activity details**, including but not limited to location, number of participants, date,
   and time.
   > If a member repeatedly proposes a suggestion that has been rejected, leading to a deadlock in the discussion, their
   > input will be considered invalid.
2. **Wide-ranging inquiry** to all members about their choice to participate in the activity and adjusting the activity
   details to satisfy the majority of participants.
3. **First targeted inquiry** to non-responsive members about their choice to participate in the activity and adjusting
   the activity details to satisfy the majority of participants.
   > If a member fails to respond even after the given timeframe, it will be considered as a withdrawal from
   > participation.
4. **Actual execution** of booking and confirming activity details, etc.
5. **Second targeted inquiry** to non-responsive members about their choice to participate in the activity, without the
   need to adjust the activity details for them.
